# odin-restaurant_page
This is the ninth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

Github page: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-restaurant_page/

(2025/05/19) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as module, npm and webpack to build a website with tab-switching logic inside. With advices in Assignment of the project, I mainly use the concept of querySelector and eventListener to design the header navbar function. The navbar can wipe out the current contents of Home page and then runs the correct ‘tab module’ to populate it with the new contents in Menu page or About page. This activity strengths my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
